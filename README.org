** Substitution model for Procedure Application
*** Normal order evaluation vs Applicative order evaluation
    - Normal order
      - Fully expand and then reduces the expressions.
      - Often leads to evaluation of same expressions twice.
    - Applicative order
      - Evaluates the arguments and then "apply"
      - Interpreter uses this method for efficiency
*** Conditional Expressions
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun abs (x)
  (if (< x 0)
      (- x)
    x))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: abs
