* It all depends on the motive
  - A type determined by something that is not a type is called a
    ~dependent~ type.
** rec-Nat vs ind-Nat
   - To use rec-Nat, base must have the same type as the step
   - ~ind-Nat~ is more powerful than ~rec-Nat~.
   - ~ind-Nat~ is used for dependent types.
   - ~ind-Nat~ takes an extra argument to state how the types of both
     the base and the step's almost answer depend on the target value.
   - This extra argument is called ~motive~
     #+BEGIN_SRC racket
     (-> Nat
         U)
     #+END_SRC
   - ~ind-Nat~ expression's type is the motive applied to the target Nat.
