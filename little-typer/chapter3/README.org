* Eliminate all Natural numbers
** Sameness
** Total function
   - A function that assigns values for every possible input argument
   - In Pie, all functions are total
** Recursion is not an option
** Nat eliminators
   - ~which-Nat~, ~rec-Nat~, ~iter-Nat~
*** which-Nat
    - It gets the smaller Nat tucked under ~add1~ constructor
*** iter-Nat
    #+BEGIN_SRC racket
    (iter-Nat target
     base
     step)
    #+END_SRC
    - ~iter-Nat~ replaces constructors similar to ~foldr~
*** rec-Nat
    - ~rec-Nat~ combines the expressiveness of ~iter-Nat~ and ~which-Nat~
    - ~rec-Nat~ is like a foldr.
    - ~rec-Nat~ is just like ~iter-Nat~ but carries recursive answer
      as an additional argument.
      #+BEGIN_SRC racket
        (rec-Nat target
         base
         step)                                  ;step is a two argument function. arg1 is smaller Nat. arg2 is recursive result so far.         
      #+END_SRC
    -
