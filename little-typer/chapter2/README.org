* Doin' what comes naturally
*** Constructors and Eliminators
    - Eliminators take apart values built by constructors.
    - Examples: ~car~, ~cdr~
    - Constructors build values. Values contain information.
      Eliminators allow that information to be used.
**** Eliminator for functions
     - Applying a function to arguments is the eliminator for functions.
**** Lambda
     - Lambda is a constructor.
     - Every expression that starts with a lambda is a value.
**** Neutral Expressions
     - Expressions that are not balues and cannot yet be evaluated due
       to a variable are called neutral.
