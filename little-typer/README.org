* The Little Typer
** Chapter 1: The More things change, the more they stay the same
*** Values
    - An expression with a constructor at the top is called a value.
    - In a value, the top constructor's arguments need not be normal.
    - In a value, if the top constructor's arguments are normal, then
      the entire constructor expression is in normal form.
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (add1
      (+ (add1 zero) (add1 one)))
    #+END_SRC
**** Are all values normal?
     - Not every value is in normal form. This is because the
       arguments to a constructor need not be normal.
     - Each expression has only one normal form.
     - It's possible to write an expression as a value in more than
       one way.
*** Expressions
    - Everything in Pie is an expression.
    - Evaluating an expression leads to an expression.
    - Values are expressions.
**** Normal Expression
     - Normal expression has no further opportunities for evaluation.
     - Easier to understand
*** Atom
    - Atoms are symbols.
    - Atom is a type.
    - Example: ~'dummy~
    - Each atom constructs itself.
    - All atoms are values.
*** Judgments
    - Judgment is an attitude that a person takes towards expressions.
*** Commandments
    1. zero is the same Nat as zero.
    2. If n is the same Nat as k, then (add1 n) is the same Nat as
       (add1 k).
    3. Neutral Expressions that are written identically are the same,
       no matter their type.
